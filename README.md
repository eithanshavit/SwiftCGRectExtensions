Swift CGRect Extensions
=======================

A collection of `CGRect`, `CGPoint` and `CGSize` convenience functions for Swift on OS X and iOS.

This is a fork of the main repo. I've introduced some convenient changes that make layout of CGRects simple and intuitive, see below. Until @nschum pulls my changes, I'll keep this as a separate project.
See main repo for more documentation.

Introducing CGRectControlPoint that lets you refer to convenient point on your CGRect. This extension then lets you manipulate these control points and pin them together. This presents a quick and readable way to preform manual layout.
See code for more documentation.
